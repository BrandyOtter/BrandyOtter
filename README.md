- 👋 Hi, I’m @BrandyOtter, aka Bob once we have been introduced.
- 👀 I’m interested in software, hardware, radio comedy and drama, music, farming and related topics, plus a wide range of other things.
- 🌱 I currently predominantly use Perl, Javascript, PHP, MySql but have used C, C++, C#, Java, Assembler, Ada, PL/SQL to varying degrees in a career I left a while back.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that I would find interesting and only slightly challenging.
- 📫 How to reach me? I'll let you know. 

I'm not sure what Github will give me and definitely won't wish to spend hour upon hour reading stuff I don't understand. So if trying to contact me, please be a little patient.
